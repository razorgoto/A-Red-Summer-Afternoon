A Red Summer Afternoon

I was sitting at a coffee shop in Kingston and met a girl I'd seen once or twice from school.

I just walked right up to her (direct) and said hello. She was waiting for a friend but it was raining and her friend might not come.

This girl (Tina) was into a poetry, and since I was a poet at the time, it was very easy. I talked to her about some poems I was reading, then segway into reading some stuff I had written.

She seemed very intent on what I'd written. Her face was calm but seemed flushed with excitement. He eyes glowed. (I had never seen anybody give me that reaction before about my writing. Made me feel really good about my art.)

She paused. Then she pointed out an incorrect word usage. I was a wordsmith, so natural feel that she was wrong and we argued a bit playfully. We were going to settle it with a dictionary. She suggest we go to the Indigo (4 block away).

We paid and left.

The rain was falling steadily we walked closely under her bright red umbrella. Not a word passed between us.

She suddenly veered off on a corner, then told me that she had a dictionary at home and we should go there instead because it was closer. I felt something, but shrugged it off. We walked to her house and it turned out to be 6 blocks away.

She invited me up to her little apartment. Then said how messy it was. (It wasn't.) We toured the house. Then settled on the couch. She went off to fix me a drink. I looked at her book collection.

She came back --- something was off. She couldn't look me in the eye. I asked about the dictionary. She snucked off and back with it. I looked upt the entry to settle our arguement; I was right... but she wasn't too interested in the answer. She just stared at me, (not at my face, but at my torso, my back, my shoulders.)

I didn't know what to do, so I asked her if it was okay if I finished the poem I was writing. She said okay. As I wrote under the red glow of her window covered with red curtains, I can feel her hovering over me, breathing heavily. Staring at my back.

I spent a really long time, pausing a lot, until she went off to another part of the apartment. To be honest, I can't write with a girl looking at me like that. I finished my poem. Then I went over to her and told her I had to leave. She had no reaction whatsoever and gave me a wooden good-bye.

There was a funny after-story to this. This girl was hot. I always thought she was cute. She had very soft, clay-coloured skin. She was a goody-goody. Shy-looking. Quiet. Artsy and did a whole bunch of visual art and literature stuff.

And after I left, I realized that I was suppose to fuck her. She was waiting for me to fuck her.

I got pretty upset. So I called her the next day.... no answer. I called her after that ... no answer. I called her again ... phone was disconnected.

I got very desperate. I started thinking about this girl. I thought there was a special connection between us. If I find her again, I can re-spark the magic.

 After a week of waiting, I decided to just go up to her
 apartment. I walked past the lobby, up the stairwell, and
 outside the door to her place. I knocked. Silence. I knocked
 louder. Nothing.

 I was about to leave when some tall white guy came to open
 the door. I was a little shocked. Then, Tina showed up and
 looked down right annoyed. She told me some bullshit about
 her phone having problems and then said that she and her
 boyfriend (white guy) was on the way out. They looked like
 they just had sex.

 I was confused. And politely apologized and left.

 I used to think that I must be an idiot. I thought "I
 misinterpreted the situation. She doesn't like me...." but
 now I know that I had it right. She was just bored that day
 and lonely because her friend ditched her. I was a cool,
 alpha-guy that showed up, wow-ed her. And from this fact
 alone, was willing to drag me back to her house and fuck me.
 She will to cheat on her boyfriend for some random guy she
 barely knew, just because he was cool.

 Woman are fucked up.
